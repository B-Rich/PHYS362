\centerline{\Large How to work a problem at the board}
\vskip0.1cm\hrule\vskip0.5cm

Over the course of the semester, you will have several opportunities
to lead a discussion of a particular homework problem at the board.
Your performance will be graded according to the attached rubric, but
some additional notes may help you as you prepare for these
opportunities.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Always start the problem with a reference.}  Tell us which
  problem you're solving.  This may seem unnecessary; we're all in the
  same class, after all, and ought to know what's going on.  It is
  sometimes the case, however, that one or more of us will be
  distracted enough before or at the beginning of class that this
  small step will be appreciated.
\item {\bf Always give a synopsis of the problem.}  This doesn't
  mean you should always read the problem text as given, but
  you do need to give us enough information to remind us what
  we're looking at.
\item {\bf Prepare.}
\item {\bf Talk to the class, not the board (or the instructor).}
\item {\bf Articulate the physics present in the problem.}
\item {\bf Explain the math.}
\item {\bf Ask for questions or other input.}
\end{itemize}
